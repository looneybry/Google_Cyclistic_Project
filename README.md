# Cyclistic Marketing Strategy Project

This project was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate. The original script provided in the course is as follows:

### Script from the Google Data Analytics Course:
"You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations."

### My Analysis and Marketing Recommendations:
I analyzed the data from Cyclistic to understand the usage patterns of casual riders and annual members. Based on these insights, I developed a comprehensive marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. My marketing recommendations, as well as the supporting analysis, are found in the [**marketing_strategy.docx**](./marketing_strategy.docx).

### Raw Datasets:
The raw data sets used for this analysis are stored on my Google Drive. You can access them here:
